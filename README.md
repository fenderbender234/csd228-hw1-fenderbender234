CSD228-HW1 Input
In this exercise we practice reading input from the terminal and deciding based on the input.

*Task*
Change the code inside of the Main() method so that it does the following:

Greet the user with the message "Welcome to number stats! How many entries do you wish to enter?"
Prompt the user for a number
Show the user the number they entered in this message : "Expecting N numbers" where N is the number the user entered
Shows the user the following statistics about the numbers that they entered as shown below:
The sum of all numbers entered:sum
The average of all numbers entered:avg
The number of zeros entered:numZeros
The number of positive numbers entered:numPositive
The number of negative numbers entered:numNegatives
Print "Done!"
In each case, print the message as shown in step 4 followed by a single ':' and the calculated number. Keep in mind that the message should be exact

*Gotchas*
Your code should be fail safe. Meaning, if the client provides an input that cannot be converted to an integer, or don't provide any input, you should keep asking them until they do. If parsing user's input fails, you should print out "Please enter an integer" and repeat. Furthermore, the first entry (number of expected numbers) could not be negative. If it is, print out "Please enter a positive integer" and repeat.

*Sample input and output*
These are two examples of how the program would behave when you run it
